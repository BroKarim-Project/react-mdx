## What is a commit?
In Git, a commit is referring to the state of your code at one specific point in time. Commits with the metadata (author, timestamp, commit message etc). Commits are used for saving progression, stating changes and merging developed pieces with others work.

## Characteristics of a Good Commit
**Atomic and focused**: A commit should be atomic - it has to represent one and only one logical change. Do not mix several independent changes in one commit.
Example:

```js
# Good commit
git commit -m "Add user authentication"
# Bad commit
git commit -m "Add user authentication and update UI styles"

```

**Descriptive Commit** Message: A descriptive commit message clearly explains what the commit does and why the change was made. It should provide enough context for others (and your future self) to understand the change without reading the code.
Example:

```js
# Good commit message
git commit -m "Fix Correct null pointer exception in user login"
# Bad commit message
git commit -m "Fix bug"
```

**Follow Conventional** Commit Guidelines: You can use the standard commit guidelines to keep your git history clean, consistent and easy to read. Usually these guidelines interpret in the form of type (feat, fix, chore, refactor docs), and short summary plus occasionally a long explanation or REF to other relative issues.
Example:
```js
# Good commit message following conventional guidelines
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT-based authentication"
git commit -m "fix(login): resolve race condition in login flow"
```
